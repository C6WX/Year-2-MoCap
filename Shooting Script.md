## Scene 2 Shot 1

### Script
Santa descends the chimney – but not smoothly. He crashes down in a heap on the floor. 
Santa (Softly):
Oh, Snowballs… 
He gets up, brushing soot off his coat. He notices a sleeping child in the bed.
Santa tiptoes around the room, only to discover the floor is covered in toys – a full minefield. 
Santa (Muttering):
Would it kill this kid to clean up a little? 
He tiptoes forward, nearly tripping a couple times. 
Santa (Whispering):
Should’ve been on the naughty list. 
He reaches the door and slips into the hallway. 
### Setup
Toys dotted around the studio, a fireplace and door marker and matts for the bed.
### Performance
Santa starts sitting down as if they fell down the chimney, then stand up and notice the kid and the toys. Santa starts creeping over all the toys towards the door. Santa goes through the door and into the hallway.
### Considerations

His foot hits a Christmas tree bauble sitting suspiciously on the top stair. 
Santa tumbles down the entire staircase.

### Performance
Santa mimes moving his hands across the hallway wall as if he couldn't see anything. When he reaches the stairs, he steps on the bauble without looking down at it.

Santa:
Coal for everyone in this awful house…

A wire snaps against his ankle. 
Santa:
What the elf?! 
A Christmas wreath drops from the ceiling, slamming down over him like a trap. Santa struggles as the drug takes hold. 
Santa (Slurring):
This situation is more tangled than a badly wrapped present…
His vision blurs. Military Men close in as Santa collapses unconscious.

Christmas tree marker and boxes for the presents. Mats for the fall.
### Performance
Santa will keep his hands stuck to his sides as if he is trapped in a wreath. Military soldiers will approach him holding weapons after santa has been trapped. Santa will then fall to his knees or fall over due to the drugged cookies.
