Oh, Snowballs… 
He gets up, brushing soot off his coat. He notices a sleeping child in the bed.
Santa tiptoes around the room, only to discover the floor is covered in toys – a full minefield. 
Santa (Muttering):
Would it kill this kid to clean up a little? 
He tiptoes forward, nearly tripping a couple times.

Should’ve been on the naughty list. 
He reaches the door and slips into the hallway.
